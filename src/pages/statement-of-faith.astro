					As a Christian fellowship, we hold to the historic truths of the Christian faith as revealed

					<h3>Scripture</h3>
					<p>
						We believe the Bible, consisting of the Old Testament and New Testament, is the inspired, 
						infallible, and authoritative Word of God. It is our final authority for faith and practice, 
						providing guidance for all aspects of life and faith.
					</p>
					<div class="verse">
						"All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness." 
						<span class="reference">- 2 Timothy 3:16</span>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="belief-card">
					<div class="belief-icon">‚úùÔ∏è</div>
					<h3>The Trinity</h3>
					<p>
						We believe in one God who exists eternally in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. 
						Each person of the Trinity is fully God, yet there is one God. This mystery is central to 
						our understanding of God's nature and character.
					</p>
					<div class="verse">
						"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father 
						and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." 
						<span class="reference">- Matthew 28:19</span>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="belief-card">
					<div class="belief-icon">üëë</div>
					<h3>Jesus Christ</h3>
					<p>
						We believe Jesus Christ is both fully God and fully human. He lived a sinless life, died 
						on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins, rose from the dead, and ascended to heaven. 
						He is our Lord and Savior, and will return again.
					</p>
					<div class="verse">
						"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him 
						shall not perish but have eternal life." 
						<span class="reference">- John 3:16</span>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="belief-card">
					<div class="belief-icon">üíî</div>
					<h3>Sin and Humanity</h3>
					<p>
						We believe all humans are created in God's image but have fallen into sin, which separates 
						us from God. This condition affects every aspect of human nature and makes us unable to save 
						ourselves or earn God's favor through our own efforts.
					</p>
					<div class="verse">
						"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." 
						<span class="reference">- Romans 3:23</span>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="belief-card">
					<div class="belief-icon">üéÅ</div>
					<h3>Salvation</h3>
					<p>
						We believe salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. It is a free 
						gift from God, not earned by good works. When we trust in Jesus Christ, we are forgiven, 
						justified, and receive eternal life.
					</p>
					<div class="verse">
						"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith‚Äîand this is not from yourselves, 
						it is the gift of God‚Äînot by works, so that no one can boast." 
						<span class="reference">- Ephesians 2:8-9</span>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="belief-card">
					<div class="belief-icon">üïäÔ∏è</div>
					<h3>The Holy Spirit</h3>
					<p>
						We believe the Holy Spirit is God, who indwells every believer at the moment of salvation. 
						The Spirit guides, teaches, comforts, and empowers us for Christian living and service. 
						He produces spiritual fruit in our lives and gives gifts for ministry.
					</p>
					<div class="verse">
						"But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you 
						all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you." 
						<span class="reference">- John 14:26</span>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="belief-card">
					<div class="belief-icon">‚õ™</div>
					<h3>The Church</h3>
					<p>
						We believe the Church is the body of Christ, composed of all true believers throughout 
						history. Local churches are communities of believers gathered for worship, fellowship, 
						discipleship, and mission. Every Christian should be part of a local church.
					</p>
					<div class="verse">
						"And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates 
						of Hades will not overcome it." 
						<span class="reference">- Matthew 16:18</span>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="belief-card">
					<div class="belief-icon">üåÖ</div>
					<h3>Second Coming</h3>
					<p>
						We believe Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly to earth. At His return, there 
						will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked, final judgment, and the 
						establishment of God's eternal kingdom.
					</p>
					<div class="verse">
						"This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way 
						you have seen him go into heaven." 
						<span class="reference">- Acts 1:11</span>

			<h2>Unity in Essentials</h2>
			<div class="unity-content">
				<p>
					While we hold firmly to these core biblical truths, we recognize that sincere Christians may 
					differ on secondary issues. In matters of doctrine, we seek unity in essentials, liberty in 
					non-essentials, and charity in all things.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our goal is not theological perfection, but heart transformation through the Gospel. We welcome 
					students who are exploring faith, asking questions, and seeking to understand what it means to 
					follow Jesus Christ in today's world.
